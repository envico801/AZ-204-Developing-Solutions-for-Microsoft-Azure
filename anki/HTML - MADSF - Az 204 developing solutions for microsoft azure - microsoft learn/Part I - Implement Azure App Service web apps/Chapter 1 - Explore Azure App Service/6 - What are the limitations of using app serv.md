==================== Question ====================  

### What are the limitations of using App Service on Linux?  

==================== Answer ====================  

App Service on Linux is not supported on the Shared pricing tier. The Azure portal only shows features that currently work for Linux apps. When deployed to built-in images, code and content are allocated a storage volume with higher and more variable disk latency compared to the container filesystem.
