==================== Question ====================  

### What is an App Service plan, and why is it important in Azure App Service?  

==================== Answer ====================  

An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run in Azure App Service. It is important because an app always runs in an App Service plan, which determines the underlying compute resources and capabilities available to the app.
