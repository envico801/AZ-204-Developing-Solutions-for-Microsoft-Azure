### Explain the overall process of automated deployment in Azure App Service.  

==================== Answer ====================  

In automated deployment, changes to the code are pushed to a source control system like Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, or Bitbucket. Azure App Service then automatically builds the code, runs tests, generates a release, and deploys the updated application to the web app.
