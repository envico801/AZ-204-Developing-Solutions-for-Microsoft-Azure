==================== Question ====================  

### Explain the concept of autoscaling in App Service plans and how it affects the apps within the plan.  

==================== Answer ====================  

App Service plans can be configured for autoscaling, which automatically adjusts the number of VM instances based on the load. When autoscaling is enabled, all apps in the same App Service plan are scaled out or in together based on the autoscale settings.
