==================== Question ====================  

### Compare and contrast the "Allow unauthenticated requests" and "Require authentication" options in App Service.  

==================== Answer ====================  

"Allow unauthenticated requests" provides more flexibility in handling anonymous requests and presenting multiple sign-in providers but requires proper handling in the application code. "Require authentication" rejects all unauthenticated traffic, which may be desirable for securing the entire application but can also prevent public access to parts of the app.
