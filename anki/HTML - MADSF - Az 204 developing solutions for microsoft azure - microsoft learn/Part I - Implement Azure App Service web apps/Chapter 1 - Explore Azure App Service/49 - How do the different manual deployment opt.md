==================== Question ====================  

### How do the different manual deployment options (Git, CLI, Zip deploy, FTP/S) compare in terms of their approach and suitability?  

==================== Answer ====================  

Git and CLI deployments are more suitable for development teams using Git for source control. Zip deploy is a simple option for uploading a ZIP file of the application. FTP/S is a traditional method but may be less efficient than the other options.
