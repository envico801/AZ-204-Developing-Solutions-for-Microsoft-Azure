==================== Question ====================  

### Explain the concept of deployment slots in Azure App Service.  

==================== Answer ====================  

When deploying a web app, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot (Standard App Service Plan tier or better). Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names, and app content and configurations can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.
