==================== Question ====================  

### What are the potential implications or consequences of allowing unauthenticated requests or requiring authentication in App Service?  

==================== Answer ====================  

Allowing unauthenticated requests defers authorization to the application code, providing more flexibility but also requiring proper handling of anonymous requests. Requiring authentication rejects all unauthenticated traffic, which may be undesirable for apps that need a publicly accessible home page.
