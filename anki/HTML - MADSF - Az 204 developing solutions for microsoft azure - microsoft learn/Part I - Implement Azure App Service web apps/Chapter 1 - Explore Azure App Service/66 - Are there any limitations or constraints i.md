==================== Question ====================  

### Are there any limitations or constraints in the authentication and authorization capabilities provided by App Service?  

==================== Answer ====================  

The documentation doesn't mention any specific limitations, but it notes that in Linux and containers, the authentication module runs in a separate container, isolated from the application code, which may limit direct integration with language frameworks.
