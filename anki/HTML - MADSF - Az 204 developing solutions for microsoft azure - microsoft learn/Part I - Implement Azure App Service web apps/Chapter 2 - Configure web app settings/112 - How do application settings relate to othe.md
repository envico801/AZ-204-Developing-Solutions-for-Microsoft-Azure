==================== Question ====================  

### How do application settings relate to other Azure services or features, such as deployment slots or backups?  

==================== Answer ====================  

Application settings can be configured to be swappable or sticky to specific deployment slots, which is useful for maintaining separate settings across different environments. Connection strings for certain Azure databases also ensure that the databases are backed up along with the app.
