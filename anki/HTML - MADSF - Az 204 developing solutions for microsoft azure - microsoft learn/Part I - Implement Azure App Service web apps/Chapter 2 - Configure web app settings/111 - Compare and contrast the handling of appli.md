==================== Question ====================  

### Compare and contrast the handling of application settings between ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core and other programming languages or frameworks in App Service.  

==================== Answer ====================  

For ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, application settings in App Service override the settings in Web.config or appsettings.json files, allowing you to keep development settings in code and production secrets in App Service. For other languages, it's recommended to use app settings instead of connection strings to access configuration values.
