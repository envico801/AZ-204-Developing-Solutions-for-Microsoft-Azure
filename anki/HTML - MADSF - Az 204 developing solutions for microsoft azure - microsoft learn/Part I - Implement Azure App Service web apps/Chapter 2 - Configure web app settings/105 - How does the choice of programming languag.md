==================== Question ====================  

### How does the choice of programming language or framework impact the way application settings are handled in App Service?  

==================== Answer ====================  

For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, application settings in App Service override the settings in Web.config or appsettings.json files. For other languages, it's recommended to use app settings instead of connection strings to access configuration values.
