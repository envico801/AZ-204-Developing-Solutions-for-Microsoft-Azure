==================== Question ====================  

### How do application settings and connection strings differ in terms of their formatting, usage, and accessibility within the application code?  

==================== Answer ====================  

Application settings are simple key-value pairs, while connection strings have a specific formatting and may require special handling in the application code to access the values. Connection strings are also typed (e.g., SQLServer, PostgreSQL) in App Service.
