==================== Question ====================  

### What is the common pattern or behavior observed when working with application settings across different deployment slots or environments?  

==================== Answer ====================  

Application settings can be configured to be swappable or sticky to specific deployment slots, allowing you to maintain separate settings for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and control which settings are swapped during deployment slot swaps.
