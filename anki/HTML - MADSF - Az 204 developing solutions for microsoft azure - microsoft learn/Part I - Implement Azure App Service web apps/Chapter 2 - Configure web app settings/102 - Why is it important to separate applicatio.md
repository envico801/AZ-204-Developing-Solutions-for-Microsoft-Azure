==================== Question ====================  

### Why is it important to separate application settings from the application code?  

==================== Answer ====================  

Separating application settings from the code is important for security, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows you to keep sensitive information out of your codebase, manage different settings for different environments, and update configuration without redeploying the entire application.
