### Part I - Implement Azure App Service web apps

#### Chapter 1 - Explore Azure App Service

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of Azure App Service?

###### ID1

A:: =============================================  
Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. It allows developers to develop in their favorite programming language or framework, and applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does Azure App Service support scalability?

###### ID2

A:: =============================================  
Azure App Service has built-in auto scale support. It allows scaling up/down (changing the resources of the underlying machine like CPU cores or RAM) and scaling out/in (increasing or decreasing the number of machine instances running the web app).

Q:: =============================================  

##### What continuous integration/deployment options are available with Azure App Service?

###### ID3

A:: =============================================  
The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on the development machine.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Explain the concept of deployment slots in Azure App Service.

###### ID4

A:: =============================================  
When deploying a web app, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot (Standard App Service Plan tier or better). Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names, and app content and configurations can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does Azure App Service handle hosting web applications on Linux?

###### ID5

A:: =============================================

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does an App Service plan define the compute resources for a web app?

###### ID22

A:: =============================================  
An App Service plan specifies the operating system (Windows or Linux), region, number of VM instances, size of VM instances, and pricing tier for the compute resources allocated to the apps within the plan.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the different components or settings that an App Service plan specifies?

###### ID23

A:: =============================================  
An App Service plan specifies the operating system (Windows or Linux), region (e.g., West US, East US), number of VM instances, size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large), and pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2).

Q:: =============================================  

##### Explain the relationship between an App Service plan and the apps running within it.

###### ID24

A:: =============================================  
An app runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan. If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they share the same VM instances. Deployment slots, diagnostic logs, backups, and WebJobs also utilize resources from the same VM instances.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How do the pricing tiers in App Service plans differ in terms of features and pricing?

###### ID25

A:: =============================================  
The pricing tiers are categorized into Shared compute (Free and Shared), Dedicated compute (Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3), and Isolated (Isolated and IsolatedV2). Higher tiers offer more VM instances for scale-out, dedicated VMs, and network isolation, with varying pricing levels.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the limitations of the Shared compute pricing tiers (Free and Shared)?

###### ID67

A:: =============================================  
The common pattern involves the user signing in with the identity provider, the provider redirecting back to App Service for callback and session establishment, and App Service serving authenticated content by including authentication cookies or headers in subsequent requests.

Q:: =============================================  

##### In what scenarios would a developer choose to use the client-directed flow (with provider SDK) over the server-directed flow?

###### ID68

A:: =============================================  
The client-directed flow is typically used for browser-less apps like REST APIs, Azure Functions, JavaScript browser clients, and native mobile apps that need to sign users in directly using the provider's SDK, as they can't present the provider's sign-in page.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does the authentication and authorization process differ between client-directed and server-directed flows?

###### ID69

A:: =============================================  
In the server-directed flow, the application delegates federated sign-in to App Service, which redirects the client to the provider's login page. In the client-directed flow, the application signs users in directly using the provider's SDK and submits the authentication token to App Service for validation.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the potential implications or consequences of allowing unauthenticated requests or requiring authentication in App Service?

###### ID70

A:: =============================================  
Allowing unauthenticated requests defers authorization to the application code, providing more flexibility but also requiring proper handling of anonymous requests. Requiring authentication rejects all unauthenticated traffic, which may be undesirable for apps that need a publicly accessible home page.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Compare and contrast the "Allow unauthenticated requests" and "Require authentication" options in App Service.

###### ID71

A:: =============================================  
"Allow unauthenticated requests" provides more flexibility in handling anonymous requests and presenting multiple sign-in providers but requires proper handling in the application code. "Require authentication" rejects all unauthenticated traffic, which may be desirable for securing the entire application but can also prevent public access to parts of the app.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does the token store relate to the overall authentication and authorization process in App Service?

###### ID72

A:: =============================================  
The token store is a repository of tokens associated with the users of the web app, API, or mobile app. It's automatically available when authentication is enabled with any provider and plays a key role in managing and validating authentication tokens.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Explain the purpose and functionality of the token store in App Service.

###### ID73

A:: =============================================  
The token store is used to store, validate, and refresh OAuth tokens issued by the configured identity providers. It manages the tokens associated with authenticated users, allowing App Service to handle token validation and renewal automatically.
