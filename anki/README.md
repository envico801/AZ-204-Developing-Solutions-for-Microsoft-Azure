### Part I - Implement Azure App Service web apps

#### Chapter 1 - Explore Azure App Service

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is Azure App Service primarily designed for?

###### ID1

A:: =============================================  
Azure App Service is designed for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of the built-in auto scale support feature in Azure App Service?

###### ID2

A:: =============================================  
It allows users to scale resources based on the usage of the web app.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does Azure App Service handle scaling resources?

###### ID3

A:: =============================================  
It scales resources up/down **(vertical)** or scales out/in **(horizontal)** based on the web app's usage.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What aspects of resources can be scaled using Azure App Service's auto-scaling support?

###### ID4

A:: =============================================  
It will depend on the type of scaling we want to achieve, for example:

* **Up and down (vertical)**: The number of cores or the amount of RAM available.

* **Out/in (horizontal)**: the number of machine instances

Q:: =============================================  

##### What integration options does Azure App Service offer for continuous integration and deployment?

###### ID5

A:: =============================================  
Azure App Service offers integration with Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the key features of continuous integration and deployment in Azure App Service?

###### ID6

A:: =============================================  
Key features include out-of-the-box integration with various repositories and automatic syncing of code and changes into web apps.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of deployment slots in Azure App Service?

###### ID7

A:: =============================================  
Deployment slots in Azure App Service allow users to use separate slots instead of the default production slot when deploying a web app.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Can content and configuration elements be swapped between deployment slots in Azure App Service?

###### ID8

A:: =============================================  
Yes, content and configuration elements can be swapped between deployment slots in Azure App Service, including the production slot.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is App Service on Linux?

###### ID9

A:: =============================================  
App Service on Linux is a feature of Azure App Service that allows hosting web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are some key features of App Service on Linux?

###### ID10

It supports custom Linux containers and includes many language-specific built-in images

Q:: =============================================  

##### Which programming languages and frameworks are supported by App Service on Linux?

###### ID11

A:: =============================================  
App Service on Linux supports various programming languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Java (JRE 8 & JRE 11), PHP, Python, .NET, and Ruby.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can you retrieve the current list of supported languages and frameworks for App Service on Linux?

###### ID12

A:: =============================================  
You can retrieve the current list of supported languages and frameworks for App Service on Linux by using the following command in the Cloud Shell: `az webapp list-runtimes --os-type linux`.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Does App Service on Linux support the Shared pricing tier?

###### ID13

A:: =============================================  
No, it lacks support on the Shared pricing tier.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does the Azure portal handle features for Linux apps in App Service on Linux?

###### ID14

A:: =============================================  
The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps in App Service on Linux. As features are enabled, they're activated on the portal.

Q:: =============================================  

##### In what scenarios is the custom container option advantageous for developers deploying to App Service on Linux?

###### ID15

A:: =============================================  
It is beneficial for apps requiring heavy read-only access to content files.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does the disk latency compare for files allocated on the **built-in content volume (Azure Storage)** versus the **container filesystem (custom container)** in App Service on Linux?

###### ID16

A:: =============================================  
There is higher disk latency for files allocated on **content volume** compared to the **container filesystem**.
