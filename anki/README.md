##### What are FTP and FTPS, and how are they used for manual deployment?

###### ID42

A:: =============================================  
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) are traditional methods of pushing code to hosting environments like App Service. They allow you to transfer files to the server for deployment.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it recommended to use deployment slots during production deployment?

###### ID43

A:: =============================================  
Using deployment slots during production deployment allows you to deploy your app to a staging environment first.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can deployment slots help eliminate downtime during deployment?

###### ID44

A:: =============================================  
By swapping staging and production slots, deployment slots can eliminate downtime. The swap operation warms up the necessary worker instances to match your production scale before transitioning

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why consider using the built-in authentication for App Service and Azure Functions?

###### ID45

A:: =============================================  
It provides out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Is it mandatory to use App Service for authentication and authorization?

##### What processes does the authentication and authorization module handle for your app?

###### ID50

A:: =============================================  
It authenticates users and clients, validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens, manages the authenticated session, and injects identity information into HTTP request headers.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What does the authentication and authorization module do with every incoming HTTP request?

###### ID51

A:: =============================================  
It passes through it before being handled by your application code.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What does the authentication flow options in App Service encompass?

###### ID52

A:: =============================================  
The authentication flow options in App Service include the server-directed flow and the client-directed flow.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How does the server-directed flow work in App Service authentication?

###### ID53

The server-directed flow delegates federated sign-in to App Service, typically used with browser apps.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the client-directed flow in App Service authentication?

###### ID54

A:: =============================================  
The client-directed flow involves the application code managing the sign-in process and is typically used with browser-less apps, REST APIs, Azure Functions, JavaScript browser clients, and native mobile apps.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What options are there for handling unauthenticated traffic in App Service?

###### ID55

A:: =============================================  
You can allow unauthenticated requests or require authentication, which can include redirection to configured identity providers or returning HTTP status codes.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What role does the built-in token store play in App Service?

###### ID56

A:: =============================================  
The built-in token store in App Service serves as a repository of tokens linked to users of web apps, APIs, or native mobile apps.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How are authentication and authorization traces handled in App Service?
