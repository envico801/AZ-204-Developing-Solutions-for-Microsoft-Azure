Q:: Why use the built-in authentication?
A:: You're not required to use App Service for authentication and authorization. Many web frameworks are bundled with security features, and you can use them if you like. If you need more flexibility than App Service provides, you can also write your own utilities. The built-in authentication feature for App Service and Azure Functions can save you time and effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers, allowing you to focus on the rest of your application.

Q:: What identity providers are available by default in App Service?
A:: App Service uses federated identity, offering several default identity providers such as Microsoft identity platform, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Any OpenID Connect provider, and GitHub.

Q:: How does the authentication and authorization module work in Azure App Service?
A:: The authentication and authorization module runs in the same sandbox as your application code. It handles authenticating users and clients with the specified identity providers, validates and stores OAuth tokens, manages authenticated sessions, and injects identity information into HTTP request headers.

Q:: What is the authentication flow in Azure App Service?
A:: The authentication flow involves two approaches: one without provider SDK and the other with provider SDK. Without the provider SDK, the application delegates federated sign-in to App Service, whereas with the provider SDK, the application signs users in to the provider manually and then submits the authentication token to App Service for validation.

Q:: What behaviors can be configured for unauthenticated requests in App Service?
A:: In App Service, you can configure behaviors for unauthenticated requests, including allowing unauthenticated requests, which defers authorization to the application code, or requiring authentication, which rejects any unauthenticated traffic to the application.

Q:: What does the built-in token store in App Service do?
A:: App Service provides a built-in token store, which is a repository of tokens associated with the users of your web apps, APIs, or native mobile apps. This token store is available immediately when you enable authentication with any provider.

Q:: How are authentication and authorization traces handled in Azure App Service?
A:: If you enable application logging, authentication and authorization traces are collected directly in your log files in Azure App Service. These traces can help diagnose authentication errors or unexpected behavior.

Q:: What are the default accessibility characteristics of apps hosted in Azure App Service?
A:: By default, apps hosted in App Service are accessible directly through the internet and can reach only internet-hosted endpoints.

Q:: What are the two main deployment types for Azure App Service?
A:: The two main deployment types for Azure App Service are multitenant public service and single-tenant App Service Environment (ASE).

Q:: What are the roles involved in Azure App Service's distributed system?
A:: The roles involved in Azure App Service's distributed system are _front ends_ and _workers_.

Q:: Why can't you directly connect the App Service network to your network?
A:: You can't directly connect the App Service network to your network because there are many different customers in the same App Service scale unit.

Q:: What are the inbound and outbound features available for Azure App Service networking?
A:: Inbound features include App-assigned address, Access restrictions, Service endpoints, and Private endpoints. Outbound features include Hybrid Connections, Gateway-required virtual network integration, and Virtual network integration.

#### Chapter 3 - Scale apps in Azure App Service

Q:: What triggers autoscaling in a system?
A:: Autoscaling can be triggered based on factors such as CPU utilization, memory occupancy, incoming request surges, or a combination of these.

Q:: How does autoscaling differ from scaling up and down?
A:: Autoscaling adjusts available resources based on demand by scaling in and out, as opposed to scaling up and down.

Q:: What is Azure App Service Autoscaling, and how does it function?
A:: Azure App Service Autoscaling monitors resource metrics of a web app and adds or removes web servers to handle increasing workloads while balancing the load between them.

Q:: What are autoscaling rules, and how do they function?
A:: Autoscaling rules define thresholds for metrics and trigger autoscale events when thresholds are crossed. These rules can also deallocate resources when workload diminishes.

Q:: When should autoscaling be considered?
A:: Autoscaling should be considered for providing elasticity, improving availability and fault tolerance, and handling short-term workload fluctuations, such as during holidays or sudden spikes in activity.

Q:: What are the limitations of autoscaling?
A:: Autoscaling may not be effective for resource-intensive processing or handling long-term growth. Additionally, it incurs overhead and may not be cost-effective for predictable growth scenarios. The number of instances of a service also affects its effectiveness.

Q:: What is autoscaling, and what does it aim to achieve?
A:: Autoscaling enables the specification of conditions for scaling a web app out and in again based on resource usage, aiming to ensure sufficient resources during peak times while managing costs during lower demand periods.

Q:: How does autoscaling help manage costs?
A:: Autoscaling helps manage costs by dynamically adjusting resource allocation according to demand, preventing over-provisioning and unnecessary expenses.

Q:: What is the significance of autoscaling in handling large volumes of requests?
A:: Autoscaling ensures that a web app can handle large volumes of requests during peak times by dynamically allocating resources to meet the demand.

Q:: What options does Azure provide for autoscaling?
A:: Azure provides options for autoscaling based on metrics like disk queue length or HTTP requests, and also allows scaling according to a schedule.

Q:: Explain how autoscaling based on a metric works.
A:: Autoscaling based on a metric involves defining autoscale rules that specify a metric to monitor and how autoscaling should respond when the metric crosses a defined threshold.

Q:: What are the available metrics for autoscale rules in a web app?
A:: Available metrics for autoscale rules in a web app include CPU Percentage, Memory Percentage, Disk Queue Length, HTTP Queue Length, Data In, and Data Out.

Q:: How does autoscaling analyze metrics over time?
A:: Autoscaling analyzes trends in metric values across all instances over time by aggregating values retrieved for a metric over a period known as the time grain, and further aggregating these values over a longer user-specified period called the Duration.

Q:: Describe autoscale actions and their purposes.
A:: Autoscale actions include scale-out (increasing instance count) and scale-in (reducing instance count), triggered by a metric crossing a threshold, and they help maintain the desired performance level of the web app.

Q:: What is the purpose of the cooldown period in autoscale actions?
A:: The cooldown period in autoscale actions prevents rapid triggering of scale events, allowing the system to stabilize between autoscale events by avoiding premature scaling decisions.

Q:: Why is it recommended to plan for scaling-in when a workload decreases?
A:: Planning for scaling-in when a workload decreases helps optimize resource usage and reduce costs during periods of lower demand.

Q:: How can autoscale rules be paired effectively?
A:: Autoscale rules can be paired effectively by defining both scale-out and scale-in rules in the same autoscale condition, each triggered by different thresholds of the same metric.

Q:: Can you describe how autoscale rules can be combined within an autoscale condition?
A:: Autoscale rules within an autoscale condition can be combined by defining multiple rules for scale-out and scale-in actions, with each rule responding to different metrics or thresholds, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in scaling operations.

Q:: What are the prerequisites for enabling autoscaling in App Service?
A:: Not all pricing tiers support autoscaling. The development pricing tiers are either limited to a single instance or they only provide manual scaling. If you've selected one of these tiers, you must first scale up to the S1 or any of the P level production tiers.

A:: The Default scale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions are active.

Q:: How can you create custom scale conditions in autoscaling?
A:: Once autoscaling is enabled, you can add your own custom scale conditions.

Q:: Describe the options available for metric-based scale conditions.
A:: A metric-based scale condition can specify the minimum and maximum number of instances to create. The maximum number can't exceed the limits defined by the pricing tier. Additionally, all scale conditions other than the default may include a schedule indicating when the condition should be applied.

Q:: What are scale rules in autoscaling?
A:: A metric-based scale condition contains one or more scale rules. You use the Add a rule link to add your own custom rules. You define the criteria that indicate when a rule should trigger an autoscale action, and the autoscale action to be performed (scale out or scale in) using the metrics, aggregations, operators, and thresholds described earlier.

Q:: How do you monitor autoscaling activity in the Azure portal?
A:: The Azure portal enables you to track when autoscaling has occurred through the Run history chart.

Q:: What information does the "Run history" chart provide?
A:: The Run history chart shows how the number of instances varies over time, and which autoscale conditions caused each change.

Q:: How can you correlate autoscaling events with resource utilization in App Service?
A:: You can use the Run history chart with the metrics shown on the Overview page to correlate the autoscaling events with resource utilization.

Q:: What are the key components of an autoscale setting?
A:: The key components of an autoscale setting include maximum, minimum, and default values of instances, along with associated metrics to scale by.

Q:: Explain the purpose of an autoscale job.
A:: An autoscale job reads the associated metric to scale by and checks if it has crossed the configured threshold for scale-out or scale-in.

Q:: How are thresholds calculated in autoscale settings? Provide an example.
A:: Thresholds in autoscale settings are calculated at an instance level. For example, "scale out by one instance when average CPU > 80% when instance count is 2" means to scale out when the average CPU across all instances is greater than 80%.

Q:: Why is it important to ensure a difference between the maximum and minimum values in autoscale settings?
A:: Ensuring a difference between the maximum and minimum values prevents situations where no scale action can occur, providing flexibility for autoscale to function effectively.

Q:: Describe the significance of choosing appropriate statistics for diagnostics metrics in autoscale settings.
A:: Choosing appropriate statistics for diagnostics metrics, such as Average, Minimum, Maximum, or Total, ensures accurate scaling decisions based on the nature of the metric being monitored.

Q:: What are the recommended practices for choosing thresholds for scale-out and scale-in in autoscale settings?
A:: Recommended practices include selecting different thresholds for scale-out and scale-in to prevent situations like "flapping" and ensuring an adequate margin between the thresholds.

Q:: Explain the concept of "flapping" in autoscale settings and how it can be avoided.
A:: "Flapping" refers to situations where scale-in and scale-out actions continually oscillate. It can be avoided by selecting thresholds carefully and ensuring a margin between scale-out and scale-in thresholds.

Q:: Provide an example of a recommended rule combination for autoscale settings and explain its functioning.
A:: An example of a recommended rule combination is to increase instances by 1 count when CPU% >= 80 and decrease instances by 1 count when CPU% <= 60. This rule combination allows for effective scaling while avoiding "flapping" situations.

Q:: What considerations should be taken into account when multiple rules are configured in an autoscale profile?
A:: When multiple rules are configured, autoscale runs if any rule is met for scale-out, while for scale-in, autoscale requires all rules to be met.

Q:: Why is selecting a safe default instance count crucial in autoscale settings?
A:: Selecting a safe default instance count ensures that the service can scale appropriately when metrics aren't available, providing stability to the autoscale process.

Q:: What conditions trigger autoscale notifications according to the text?
A:: Autoscale notifications are triggered when autoscale issues a scale operation, successfully completes a scale action, fails to take a scale action, metrics aren't available for scale decisions, or metrics become available again.

Q:: How can one monitor the health of the autoscale engine based on the provided text?
A:: One can monitor the health of the autoscale engine by using Activity Log alerts and configuring email or webhook notifications for successful scale actions via the notifications tab on the autoscale setting.

#### Chapter 4 - Explore Azure App Service deployment slots

Q:: What are deployment slots in Azure App Service, and how do they function in different tiers?
A:: Deployment slots in Azure App Service are live apps with their own host names, allowing you to deploy your web app, web app on Linux, mobile back end, or API app. They function differently depending on the tier of your App Service plan. Specifically, they are available in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated tiers.

Q:: What benefits are associated with deploying an application to a non-production slot before swapping it with the production slot?
A:: Deploying an application to a non-production slot offers several benefits:

1. It allows you to validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping them with the production slot.
2. Deploying to a slot first ensures that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production, eliminating downtime.
3. Traffic redirection during swap operations is seamless, and no requests are dropped.

Q:: How does deploying to a staging deployment slot help in validating app changes?
A:: Deploying to a staging deployment slot enables you to validate app changes before swapping them with the production slot. This ensures that potential issues are identified and resolved before impacting the live production environment.

Q:: Explain the process of swapping deployment slots in Azure App Service.
A:: The process of swapping deployment slots involves swapping the content and configuration elements between two deployment slots, including the production slot. This allows you to seamlessly transition changes from a staging slot to the production slot without causing downtime or dropping requests.

Q:: Why is warming up instances of the slot important before swapping it into production?
A:: Warming up instances of the slot before swapping them into production ensures that the application is ready to handle incoming traffic. This helps to prevent performance issues or downtime that may occur if the instances are not warmed up.

Q:: How does Azure App Service handle traffic redirection during swap operations?
A:: Azure App Service handles traffic redirection during swap operations seamlessly, ensuring that no requests are dropped and that the transition between slots is smooth. This allows for uninterrupted service for users accessing the application.

Q:: What is the significance of having the "last known good site" when performing a swap in Azure App Service?
A:: Having the "last known good site" allows you to revert to the previous production app if the changes swapped into the production slot are not as expected. This provides a safety net in case issues arise during the swap process.

Q:: Is there any additional charge for using deployment slots in Azure App Service?
A:: No, there is no extra charge for using deployment slots in Azure App Service. They are included as part of the features offered within the Standard, Premium, or Isolated tiers.

Q:: How can you automate the workflow of swapping deployment slots in Azure App Service?
A:: You can automate the workflow of swapping deployment slots by configuring auto swap. Auto swap automatically swaps the staging slot with the production slot without the need for manual intervention, streamlining the deployment process.

Q:: What limitations should you consider when scaling your app to a different tier in Azure App Service?
A:: When scaling your app to a different tier in Azure App Service, you should consider the limitations regarding the number of deployment slots supported by each tier. For example, if your app has more than five slots, you cannot scale it down to the Standard tier, as the Standard tier supports only five deployment slots.

Q:: What precautions does App Service take to prevent downtime during slot swapping?
A:: App Service ensures that the target slot doesn't experience downtime during slot swapping by applying the target slot's settings to all instances of the source slot, triggering restarts if necessary, and initializing local cache and application initiation.

Q:: How does App Service handle settings during slot swapping, particularly in the case of slot-specific app settings and connection strings?
A:: During slot swapping, App Service applies slot-specific app settings and connection strings from the target slot to all instances of the source slot, triggering restarts as needed to ensure synchronization.

Q:: During a swap with preview, what actions occur after applying the target slot's settings to all instances of the source slot?
A:: After applying the target slot's settings to all instances of the source slot during a swap with preview, the first phase ends, allowing validation of the source slot with the target slot's settings.

Q:: What happens if any instance fails to restart during the slot swapping process?
A:: If any instance fails to restart during the slot swapping process, the swap operation reverts all changes to the source slot and halts the operation.

Q:: Describe the role of local cache initialization in the slot swapping procedure.
A:: Local cache initialization triggers restarts on each instance of the source slot and is performed by making an HTTP request to the application root ("/") on each instance.

Q:: How does App Service handle Application Initiation during slot swapping when auto swap is enabled with custom warm-up?
A:: App Service triggers Application Initiation by making HTTP requests to the application root ("/") on each instance of the source slot, marking instances as warmed up if they return any HTTP response.

Q:: What determines if a slot is considered "warmed up" during the slot swapping process?
A:: During slot swapping, a slot is considered "warmed up" if all instances on the source slot respond successfully to the Application Initiation requests.

Q:: Explain the significance of the routing rules switching during the slot swapping operation.
A:: Switching routing rules during slot swapping directs traffic from the source slot to the target slot, ensuring a seamless transition of apps without downtime.

Q:: How does the configuration differ between swapped and unswapped settings in App Service?
A:: Swapped settings, such as general settings, app settings, and connection strings, are synchronized between slots, while unswapped settings, like custom domain names and non-public certificates, remain specific to their respective slots.

Q:: What measures can be taken to ensure certain settings stick to a specific slot and are not affected by slot swapping?
A:: To ensure certain settings stick to a specific slot, the `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS` app setting must be added to every slot of the app and set to `0` or `false`.

Q:: How does the presence of the `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS` app setting affect the swappability of settings in App Service?
A:: The presence of the `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS` app setting determines whether settings are swappable or not in App Service, affecting the synchronization behavior during slot swapping.

Q:: What options are available to configure app settings or connection strings to stick to a specific slot and not be affected by swapping?
A:: To configure app settings or connection strings to stick to a specific slot, settings should be edited in the Configuration page for that slot, with the "Deployment slot setting" checkbox selected to indicate that the setting isn't swappable.

Q:: What is the purpose of swapping deployment slots?
A:: Swapping deployment slots allows you to move an application from one slot to another, such as from a staging environment to production, with minimal downtime and risk.

Q:: How can you manually swap deployment slots?
A:: To manually swap deployment slots, you need to go to your app's **Deployment slots** page, select **Swap**, choose the desired **Source** and **Target** slots, verify configuration changes, and then initiate the swap.

Q:: What is the advantage of performing a swap with preview?
A:: Performing a swap with preview allows you to validate how your application runs with the swapped settings before completing the swap. It also warms up the source slot, which is beneficial for mission-critical applications.

Q:: How do you configure auto swap?
A:: To configure auto swap, you need to go to your app's resource page, select the deployment slot you want to configure, turn on **Auto swap enabled**, choose the target slot for auto swap deployment, and save the settings.

Q:: What action should you take if errors occur in the target slot after a slot swap?
A:: If errors occur in the target slot after a slot swap, you should immediately swap the same two slots again to restore them to their pre-swap states.

Q:: How can you monitor a swap operation?
A:: To monitor a swap operation, you can access the activity log on your app's resource page in the portal and look for the `Swap Web App Slots` operation. You can expand it to view suboperations or errors for more details.

Q:: What is the default behavior for client requests to an app's production URL in App Service?
A:: By default, all client requests to the app's production URL (`http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`) are routed to the production slot.

Q:: Why might you want to route a portion of the traffic to another slot in App Service?
A:: This feature is useful if you need user feedback for a new update, but you're not ready to release it to production.

Q:: How can you route production traffic automatically in App Service?
A:: To route production traffic automatically, go to your app's resource page, select **Deployment slots**, and in the **Traffic %** column of the slot you want to route to, specify a percentage (between 0 and 100) to represent the amount of total traffic you want to route. Then select **Save**.

Q:: What does it mean when a client is "pinned" to a specific slot in App Service?
A:: When a client is automatically routed to a specific slot, it's "pinned" to that slot for the life of that client session.

Q:: How can you determine which slot a client session is pinned to in App Service?
A:: You can determine which slot a client session is pinned to by looking at the `x-ms-routing-name` cookie in your HTTP headers.

Q:: What is the purpose of routing production traffic manually in App Service?
A:: The purpose of routing production traffic manually in App Service is to allow users to opt in to or opt out of a beta app.

Q:: How can users opt out of a beta app in App Service using manual traffic routing?
A:: Users can opt out of a beta app in App Service by accessing a link on your webpage that contains the query parameter `x-ms-routing-name=self`.

Q:: How can users opt in to a beta app in App Service using manual traffic routing?
A:: Users can opt in to a beta app in App Service by accessing a link that contains the query parameter `x-ms-routing-name` set to the name of the non-production slot.

Q:: What happens when the `x-ms-routing-name` query parameter is set to `self` in App Service?
A:: When the `x-ms-routing-name` query parameter is set to `self` in App Service, the client browser is redirected to the production slot.

Q:: How can you access the staging slot manually in App Service, even if the routing percentage is set to 0?
A:: By default, new slots are given a routing rule of `0%`. Users can access the staging slot manually by using the `x-ms-routing-name` query parameter, even if the routing percentage is set to 0.
