========== Question ==========  

### What trade-offs or considerations should be taken into account when deciding between storing settings in the application code versus in App Service settings?  

========== Answer ==========  

Storing settings in the application code may be simpler for small applications
or during development, but it can lead to security risks and inflexibility when
managing different environments. Storing settings in App Service requires more
setup and management but provides better security, flexibility, and separation
of concerns.
