========== Question ==========  

### Explain the concept of "sticky" or "swappable" settings in the context of deployment slots in App Service.  

========== Answer ==========  

Sticky settings are tied to a specific deployment slot and are not swapped
during a slot swap. Swappable settings are shared across deployment slots and
are swapped during a slot swap. This allows you to maintain separate settings
for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
