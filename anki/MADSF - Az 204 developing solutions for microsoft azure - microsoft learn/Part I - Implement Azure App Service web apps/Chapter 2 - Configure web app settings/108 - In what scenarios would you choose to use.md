========== Question ==========  

### In what scenarios would you choose to use application settings over connection strings or vice versa?  

========== Answer ==========  

Application settings are generally preferred for storing configuration values
and secrets, as they are easier to access and manage. Connection strings are
recommended for database connections, especially for Azure databases that are
backed up along with the app when a connection string is configured.
