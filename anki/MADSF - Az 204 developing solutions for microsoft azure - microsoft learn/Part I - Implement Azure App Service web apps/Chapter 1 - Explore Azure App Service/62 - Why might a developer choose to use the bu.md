========== Question ==========  

### Why might a developer choose to use the built-in authentication in App Service instead of implementing their own solution?  

========== Answer ==========  

Developers might choose the built-in authentication because it can save time and
effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity
providers, allowing them to focus on the rest of their application. It's also
built directly into the platform and doesn't require any particular language,
SDK, security expertise, or code.
