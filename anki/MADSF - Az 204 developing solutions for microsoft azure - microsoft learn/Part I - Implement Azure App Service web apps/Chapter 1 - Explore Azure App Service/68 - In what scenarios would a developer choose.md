========== Question ==========  

### In what scenarios would a developer choose to use the client-directed flow (with provider SDK) over the server-directed flow?  

========== Answer ==========  

The client-directed flow is typically used for browser-less apps like REST APIs,
Azure Functions, JavaScript browser clients, and native mobile apps that need to
sign users in directly using the provider's SDK, as they can't present the
provider's sign-in page.
